I will update your MacOS machine with Better™ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps that my developer friends find helpful.

# Forget About Manual Configuration!

Don't you hate getting a new laptop or joining a new team and then spending a whole day setting up your system preferences and tools.
Its kind pain in the ass. That's why we automate; we did it once and we don't want to do have to do it again.

When I finish with your machine, you will be able to look at your command-line in full-screen mode like this (running iTerm):

![iTerm Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alperhankendi/dotfiles/master/img/bg.png)

Check out how your shell prompt includes the full path, node.js version & the working git branch along with a lot of other info!
I use powerlevel10k (upgraded from powerlevel9k, 10x better performence) for command prompt, so customization of what you want is easily changable in `./.zshrc`
The top terminal is using vim as a full replacement IDE.
The bottom left two are git terminals.
The bottom right is running `vtop`

To launch fullscreen, hit `Command + Enter` in iTerm, then use `Command + d` to create split panes.


# Installation

> Note: I recommend forking this repo in case you don't like anything I do and want to set your own preferences (and pull request them!)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:AlexSemykin/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles;
# run this using terminal (not iTerm, lest iTerm settings get discarded on exit)
./install.sh
```

> Note: running install.sh is idempotent. You can run it again and again as you add new features or software to the scripts! I'll regularly add new configurations so keep an eye on this repo as it grows and optimizes.
